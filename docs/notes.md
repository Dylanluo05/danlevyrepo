## 5.1
- People create computing innovations
- The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations
- Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance
- A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people or even a single person
Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts
Beneficial and Harmful Effects
(Quadcopter, Wii)
- Benefit: Deliveries, finding lost people, aerial photography
- Harm: Flying in unregulated zones, privacy concerns
- Benefit: Gets people active
- Harm: Broken TV and injuries
- 3D Printer Benefits: Open source software for computer and printer, in schools and homes, and special 3D printers can make several things; example of computing innovations and increased creativity
- Practice Question: B, Correct, because you presume it will work as intended unless stated otherwise
- The Internet: It was originally for scientists, but it has become more mainstream
- Harms: Very reliant on WWW, dopamine feedback loops, sleep deprivation, depression, anxiety, impulsivity
- Microtransactions: Example of how some computing innovations can have a harmful impact on society, the economy, or culture

## 5.2
- Internet access varies between socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic characteristics, as well as between countries
- The digital divide refers to differing access to computing devices and the Internet, based on socioeconomic, graphic, or demographic characteristics
- The digital divide can affect both groups and individuals
- The digital divide raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally
- The digital divide is affected by the actions of individuals, organizations, and governments
- Computers are not that common in rural areas, only a small number of websites could be available, the  Internet is used to protect and advocate the government, and there is a high level of surveillance on the internet to protect the government
- Practice Question 1: C, Correct, because providing computers can provide equity

## 5.3
- Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation
- Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases
- Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development


- Explicit data for Netflix::
  - Thumbs
  - Name, address
  - Implicit Data:
  - When you watch
  - What you binged
  - Style of show frequently selected
  - Bias
  - Subscriptions

- Loan Companies
  - Creating software to assist loan officers
  - Find trends in successful loans
  - Reject those who don't fit trends for age, gender, or race/ethnicity 

- All software can be biased towards a demographic

- Questions to ask about bias:
  - Enhancing or intentionally excluding?
  - Intentionally harmful or hateful?
  - Receiving feedback from a wide variety of people?

## 5.4
- Public Data Sets: Examples include Kaggle, Google Public Datasets, Data.gov, and local government data sets
- Distributed Computing
  - Study of computer systems that communicate amongst each other
  - Examples: Folding@Home (Stanford) and BOINC (UCB)
  - Science has been affected using distributed and citizen science
  - Citizen science is research conducted by distributed individuals
  - Human capabilities can be enhanced via computing
  - Crowdsourcing  is where individuals or organizations obtain goods and services
  - EX: Spotify, Crowdfunding, Blockchain
